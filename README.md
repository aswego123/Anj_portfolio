Data Science projects:

**Project 1. Data Analytics for Restaurant Management**

The data collection team of a restaurant-based business handed over a set of data related to the restaurant's performance, which was to be analysed to find valuable insights. This data analytics project focuses on deriving insights from the information provided using various aspects and tools in data analytics. The aim is to provide some exciting business recommendations to the upper-level management executive in the company that runs a restaurant business in India.
After getting familiarised with the data, a data cleansing process was initially undertaken to perform a sanity check and address missing and erroneous values. This was followed by data visualisation and calculating the descriptive statistics. By interpreting the results of visualisation and descriptive statistics, the problem statement, i.e., the potential area of improvement, was identified.

Some results based on the data provided to us:

After getting familiarized with the data, a data cleaning process was done and was followed by data visualization and calculating the descriptive statistics.
